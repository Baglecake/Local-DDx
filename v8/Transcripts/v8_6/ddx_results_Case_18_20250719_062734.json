Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. What is the most likely etiologic agent?\n",

The risk level is HIGH.\n- **Malaria** - Given the patient's travel history to Brazil, malaria should be considered, especially in the presence of fever, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias. Malaria can cause neurological complications and is a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly. The risk level is HIGH.\n\n**IMMEDIATE_WORKUP**\n- **Serological Testing for Zika Virus** - Perform IgM and IgG tests for Zika virus to assess for recent or past infection.\n- **PCR Testing for CMV** - Obtain amniotic fluid or maternal blood for CMV PCR to assess for congenital CMV infection.\n- **Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)** - Conduct a malaria RDT to rule out malaria infection.\n\n**TIME_SENSITIVITY**\n- **Zika Virus Infection** - The patient should be evaluated for Zika virus infection as soon as possible to determine if antiviral therapy is appropriate.\n- **Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection** - Prompt evaluation and testing for CMV are critical to initiate antiviral therapy if necessary.\n- **Malaria** - Immediate testing for malaria is essential to start antimalarial treatment if malaria is confirmed.\n\nThese conditions must be ruled out or treated as soon as possible to prevent potential neurological complications and to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient and the fetus.",

Zika Virus Infection**\n- **Evidence**: The patient's history of travel to Brazil, where Zika is endemic, along with the reported symptoms (fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash) that resolved without treatment. Additionally, the presence of fetal microcephaly on ultrasound is a critical finding, as Zika virus is known to cause congenital microcephaly.\n- **Why it can't be missed**: Zika virus can cause congenital infections leading to severe neurological and developmental issues in the fetus. Immediate diagnosis and management are crucial to prevent potential long-term complications.\n- **Risk Level**: HIGH\n\n**2. Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection**\n- **Evidence**: The patient's history of fever and headache, which are common symptoms of CMV infection. The presence of fetal microcephaly on ultrasound is a critical finding, as CMV can also cause congenital infections leading to microcephaly.\n- **Why it can't be missed**: CMV can cause congenital infections in the fetus, leading to microcephaly and other neurological complications. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the best possible outcomes.\n- **Risk Level**: HIGH\n\n**3. Malaria**\n- **Evidence**: The patient's travel history to Brazil, which is a malaria-endemic area, and the presence of symptoms such as fever, headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias. These symptoms are characteristic of malaria, and the risk of malaria in pregnant women is particularly concerning due to the potential for severe maternal and fetal complications.\n- **Why it can't be missed**: Malaria can cause severe maternal and fetal complications, including anemia, hypoglycemia, and low birth weight. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent these complications.\n- **Risk Level**: HIGH\n\n### IMMEDIATE WORKUP\n\n- **Required Test/Intervention**: \n  - Malaria blood smear or rapid diagnostic test (RDT)\n  - Maternal blood for CMV IgM and IgG antibodies\n  - Maternal blood for Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies\n  - Amniocentesis for fetal CMV PCR and amniotic fluid analysis\n\n### TIME SENSITIVITY\n\n- **How quickly these conditions must be ruled out or treated**: Immediate. Malaria and Zika virus infections can rapidly progress, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe maternal and fetal complications. CMV infection also requires prompt diagnosis and management to optimize fetal outcomes.\n\nThese diagnoses are prioritized based on the risk of immediate harm if missed, given the potential for severe neurological and developmental complications in the fetus. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.",

Zika Virus Infection:**\n- **Evidence:** The patient's recent travel to Brazil, where Zika virus is endemic, along with the presence of fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, strongly suggest a recent Zika virus infection. Additionally, fetal microcephaly is a known complication of Zika virus infection in utero.\n- **Why it can't be missed:** Zika virus infection during pregnancy can lead to severe complications, including congenital Zika syndrome, which is characterized by microcephaly and other birth defects. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to manage the potential complications.\n- **Risk level:** HIGH\n- **Immediate workup:** Perform RT-PCR for Zika virus RNA in serum and urine, and consider testing for Zika virus IgM and IgG antibodies.\n- **Time sensitivity:** Immediate workup is essential to confirm or rule out the presence of Zika virus and to initiate appropriate management, such as antiviral therapy and close monitoring of the pregnancy.\n\n**2. Malaria:**\n- **Evidence:** The patient's recent travel to Brazil, where malaria is endemic, along with the presence of fever, headache, and myalgias, raises the possibility of malaria. Malaria can present with similar symptoms and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n- **Why it can't be missed:** Malaria can cause severe complications, including organ failure and death if not treated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical.\n- **Risk level:** HIGH\n- **Immediate workup:** Perform a blood smear for malaria parasites and consider a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria.\n- **Time sensitivity:** Immediate workup is necessary to initiate antimalarial therapy, such as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), to prevent severe complications.\n\n**3. Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection:**\n- **Evidence:** The presence of fetal microcephaly, along with the patient's recent travel to Brazil, where cytomegalovirus (CMV) is common, suggests a potential congenital CMV infection. CMV can cause microcephaly and other congenital anomalies.\n- **Why it can't be missed:** Congenital CMV infection can lead to severe developmental and neurological complications in the fetus. Early diagnosis and management are important for the best possible outcome.\n- **Risk level:** HIGH\n- **Immediate workup:** Perform CMV IgM and IgG testing in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Consider amniocentesis if the maternal IgM is positive or if there is a high suspicion of congenital CMV infection.\n- **Time sensitivity:** Early diagnosis and management are crucial to monitor and manage the potential complications of congenital CMV infection.\n\nIn summary, the most critical diagnoses to consider are Zika virus infection, malaria, and congenital cytomegalovirus infection. Immediate workup and timely management are essential to prevent severe complications and to ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and the fetus.",
