    "case_description": "\nA 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n",

This condition must be ruled out or managed to prevent further respiratory compromise. **Risk level: HIGH**\n\n### IMMEDIATE_WORKUP\n- **Thoracic Intubation** - Immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, as the patient is in respiratory distress and hypoxemic.\n- **Pleural Drainage** - Immediate chest tube placement to decompress the left-sided pneumothorax or hemothorax, if present, to relieve the tension on the left mainstem bronchus and improve respiratory function.\n\n### TIME_SENSITIVITY\n- **Immediate** - These conditions must be identified and managed as soon as possible to prevent further respiratory compromise and potential cardiovascular collapse. The patient's current state of respiratory distress and hypotension indicates an urgent need for intervention.\n\nThe systematic review of the chest x-ray findings, along with the clinical presentation, highlights the critical nature of these diagnoses.
