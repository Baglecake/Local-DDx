💡 ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 1. ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - clinical success rate only 50.0%
 2. 🔬 CLINICAL BINARY LOGIC: Success = TP(2) + AE(1) = 3/6 | Failure = TM(2) = 2/6
 3. ✅ CLINICAL REASONING CREDIT: 1 diagnoses appropriately excluded with evidence-based reasoning - counted as clinical successes
 4. 📊 TRADITIONAL vs CLINICAL: Traditional recall (33.3%) vs Clinical success (50.0%) - +16.7% difference due to crediting good exclusions
 5. ❌ ACTUAL FAILURES: 2 diagnoses completely missed (failure rate: 33.3%) - these represent true diagnostic inadequacy
 6. 🔧 PRIORITY: Reduce true miss rate - focus on improving recognition of ground truth conditions
 7. 🔧 SECONDARY: Improve diagnostic precision - refine equivalence matching or selection criteria

📈 METRIC EXPLANATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLINICAL BINARY REFRAMING:
• Clinical Success (50.0%): TP + AE = both represent appropriate handling
• Clinical Failure (33.3%): TM only = actual diagnostic inadequacy
• Diagnostic Precision: TP / System Diagnoses = accuracy of proposed diagnoses

KEY INSIGHT: "Appropriately Excluded" diagnoses represent EXCELLENT clinical performance - 
they were considered, evaluated, and correctly ruled out with proper reasoning. This is 
exactly what we want from clinical decision-making.

TRADITIONAL vs CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES:
• Traditional Recall (33.3%): Treats AE as failures (clinically wrong)
• Clinical Success (50.0%): Credits AE as good medicine (clinically correct)
• Gap: +16.7% represents the value of appropriate clinical exclusions

PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES (Clinical Binary):
• EXCELLENT: >80% clinical success, <20% clinical failure
• GOOD: >60% clinical success, <30% clinical failure  
• FAIR: >40% clinical success, <50% clinical failure
• POOR: <40% clinical success or >50% clinical failure

ACTIONABLE METRICS:
• Clinical Failure Rate: PRIORITY - represents actual diagnostic inadequacy
• Clinical Success Rate: Overall clinical competence - credits both matches and good exclusions
• Diagnostic Precision: Accuracy of final diagnosis list - unchanged from traditional

CLINICAL LOGIC:
This normalized binary approach reflects how medicine actually works - good clinicians 
consider relevant diagnoses and make evidence-based decisions to include or exclude them. 
Both actions represent clinical competence when done with proper reasoning.
