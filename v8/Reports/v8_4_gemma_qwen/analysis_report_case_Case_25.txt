💡 ANALYTICAL INSIGHTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 1. ✅ GOOD clinical performance (66.7%) - system appropriately handled 2/3 ground truth diagnoses
 2. 🔬 CLINICAL BINARY LOGIC: Success = TP(2) + AE(0) = 2/3 | Failure = TM(1) = 1/3
 3. ❌ ACTUAL FAILURES: 1 diagnoses completely missed (failure rate: 33.3%) - these represent true diagnostic inadequacy
 4. 🔧 PRIORITY: Reduce true miss rate - focus on improving recognition of ground truth conditions

📈 METRIC EXPLANATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLINICAL BINARY REFRAMING:
• Clinical Success (66.7%): TP + AE = both represent appropriate handling
• Clinical Failure (33.3%): TM only = actual diagnostic inadequacy
• Diagnostic Precision: TP / System Diagnoses = accuracy of proposed diagnoses

KEY INSIGHT: "Appropriately Excluded" diagnoses represent EXCELLENT clinical performance -
they were considered, evaluated, and correctly ruled out with proper reasoning. This is
exactly what we want from clinical decision-making.

TRADITIONAL vs CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES:
• Traditional Recall (66.7%): Treats AE as failures (clinically wrong)
• Clinical Success (66.7%): Credits AE as good medicine (clinically correct)
• Gap: +0.0% represents the value of appropriate clinical exclusions

PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES (Clinical Binary):
• EXCELLENT: >80% clinical success, <20% clinical failure
• GOOD: >60% clinical success, <30% clinical failure
• FAIR: >40% clinical success, <50% clinical failure
• POOR: <40% clinical success or >50% clinical failure

ACTIONABLE METRICS:
• Clinical Failure Rate: PRIORITY - represents actual diagnostic inadequacy
• Clinical Success Rate: Overall clinical competence - credits both matches and good exclusions
• Diagnostic Precision: Accuracy of final diagnosis list - unchanged from traditional

CLINICAL LOGIC:
This normalized binary approach reflects how medicine actually works - good clinicians
consider relevant diagnoses and make evidence-based decisions to include or exclude them.
Both actions represent clinical competence when done with proper reasoning.
