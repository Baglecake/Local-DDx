His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest.

The patient's dandruff could be related to a potential autoimmune etiology.\n2. Psoriatic Arthritis - 40% - The patient's pitting nails and history of arthritis suggest a potential connection to psoriatic arthritis. The dandruff could also be related to psoriasis, another autoimmune condition.\n3. Osteoarthritis - 20% - While the patient's age and history of arthritis could suggest osteoarthritis, the bilateral knee swelling and the improvement with rest are less typical of osteoarthritis.\n4. Gout - 10% - The patient's nail changes could be suggestive of gout, but the bilateral knee swelling and pain are less typical of gout, which usually presents with acute, monoarticular attacks.\n5. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) - 10% - The patient's joint pain, back pain, and nail changes could be suggestive of SLE, but the history of arthritis makes this less likely.\n</DIFFERENTIAL_DIAGNOSIS>\n\n<SPECIALTY_FOCUS>\nGiven the patient's history of arthritis and the current presentation, the primary focus should be on autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The bilateral knee swelling and pain, along with the improvement with rest, suggest an inflammatory process. The pitting of the nails and dandruff could be related to an autoimmune etiology. Further testing, such as rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, and anti-nuclear antibody tests, should be performed to help narrow down the diagnosis.\n</SPECIALTY_FOCUS>",

Nail pitting is a hallmark physical finding in psoriatic arthritis, and the concurrent presence of dandruff also points towards psoriasis, a related autoimmune condition. However, since the patient was diagnosed with arthritis 16 years ago, it may suggest a longer duration of the disease, making it less likely to be psoriatic arthritis as it usually develops later in life.\n\n2. Rheumatoid Arthritis - Given the patient's history of arthritis, bilateral joint involvement, and age, rheumatoid arthritis is a strong possibility. However, the presence of nail pitting is less common in rheumatoid arthritis compared to psoriatic arthritis, making it less likely.\n\n3. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - The patient's joint pain, back pain, and pitting nails could be indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus.
